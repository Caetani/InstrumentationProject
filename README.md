# InstrumentationProject
### In this repository there are some of the scripts and files used that I used in my final instrumentation project during my Electrical Engineering course at UFRGS.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to design and simulate an electronic measurement system. 
The system was designed to measure temperature, pressure and molecular weight of natural gas samples.
With those three quantities measured, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network was trained to predict the mass density of the gas sample. 

For complete information about the project and it's development, the file "Project Report.pdf" can be read.
If there are still any doubts, please contact me.
